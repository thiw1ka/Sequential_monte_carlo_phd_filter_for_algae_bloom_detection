# Sequential_monte_carlo_phd_filter_for_algae_bloom_detection
Sequential monte carlo implementation of the phd filter is implemented here for tracking algae blooms in fresh water lakes. This is a proof concept implementation done using Gazebo simulation. Particle filter is implemented to keep a track on the bloom in the water.
